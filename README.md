# Household-Energy-Consumption-Analysis-Excel-
## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world household electricity consumption data to demonstrate Excel-based data cleaning, time-series analysis, pivot tables, and dashboard creation. The dataset contains minute-level power usage measurements with missing values and multiple energy variables, closely resembling real business data.

## 📁 Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Data Type: Time-series electricity consumption

Challenges: Missing values, large volume, multiple power metrics

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Replaced missing values and handled data quality issues

Combined date and time into a unified datetime field

Converted text fields to numeric values

Engineered new features: hour of day, month, and weekend flag

## 🧮 Analysis & KPIs

Key analyses performed include:

Hourly electricity usage patterns

Monthly consumption trends

Weekday vs weekend usage comparison

Sub-meter contribution analysis

Voltage stability analysis using monthly averages and variability

Top KPIs:

Average Daily Electricity Consumption

Peak Usage Hour

Highest Consumption Month

Weekend vs Weekday Usage Difference

Top Energy-Consuming Sub-Meter

📊 Dashboard

An interactive Excel dashboard was built to summarize insights using:

KPI cards

Line and column charts

Pivot-table-driven visuals

The dashboard enables quick understanding of consumption behavior and key energy drivers.

## 🧠 Key Insights

Electricity demand peaks during evening hours, reflecting residential usage patterns.

Weekend consumption is higher than weekdays, indicating increased home activity.

One sub-meter accounts for the largest share of energy usage, highlighting a key optimization opportunity.

Voltage levels remain stable across months, indicating consistent power supply quality.

## 🛠 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Pivot Tables

Advanced formulas (SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, IF, INDEX/MATCH, VLOOKUP)

Dashboard design

## 📌 Purpose

This project was created as a portfolio project to showcase practical Excel skills for data analysis and business decision support.
